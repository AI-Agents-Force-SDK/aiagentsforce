# How to install AI Agents Force packages

The AI Agents Force ecosystem is split into different packages, which allow you to choose exactly which pieces of
functionality to install.

## Official release

To install the main `langchain` package, run:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="pip" label="Pip" default>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">pip install langchain</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="conda" label="Conda">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">conda install langchain -c conda-forge</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

While this package acts as a sane starting point to using AI Agents Force,
much of the value of AI Agents Force comes when integrating it with various model providers, datastores, etc.
By default, the dependencies needed to do that are NOT installed. You will need to install the dependencies for specific integrations separately, which we show below.

## Ecosystem packages

With the exception of the `langsmith` SDK, all packages in the AI Agents Force ecosystem depend on `langchain-core`, which contains base
classes and abstractions that other packages use. The dependency graph below shows how the different packages are related.
A directed arrow indicates that the source package depends on the target package:

When installing a package, you do not need to explicitly install that package's explicit dependencies (such as `langchain-core`).
However, you may choose to if you are using a feature only available in a certain version of that dependency.
If you do, you should make sure that the installed or pinned version is compatible with any other integration packages you use.

### AI Agents Force core
The `langchain-core` package contains base abstractions that the rest of the AI Agents Force ecosystem uses, along with the AI Agents Force Expression Language. It is automatically installed by `langchain`, but can also be used separately. Install with:

```bash
pip install langchain-core
```

### Integration packages

Certain integrations like OpenAI and Anthropic have their own packages.
Any integrations that require their own package will be documented as such in the [Integration docs](/docs/integrations/providers/).
You can see a list of all integration packages in the [API reference](https://docs.aiagentsforce.com/api_reference/) under the "Partner libs" dropdown.
To install one of these run:

```bash
pip install langchain-openai
```

Any integrations that haven't been split out into their own packages will live in the `langchain-community` package. Install with:

```bash
pip install langchain-community
```

### AI Agents Force experimental
The `langchain-experimental` package holds experimental AI Agents Force code, intended for research and experimental uses.
Install with:

```bash
pip install langchain-experimental
```

### LangGraph
`langgraph` is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It integrates smoothly with AI Agents Force, but can be used without it.
Install with:

```bash
pip install langgraph
```

### aiagentsforceapi
aiagentsforceapi helps developers deploy AI Agents Force runnables and chains as a REST API.
aiagentsforceapi is automatically installed by AI Agents Force CLI.
If not using AI Agents Force CLI, install with:

```bash
pip install "aiagentsforceapi[all]"
```
for both client and server dependencies. Or `pip install "aiagentsforceapi[client]"` for client code, and `pip install "aiagentsforceapi[server]"` for server code.

### AI Agents Force CLI
The AI Agents Force CLI is useful for working with AI Agents Force templates and other aiagentsforceapi projects.
Install with:

```bash
pip install langchain-cli
```

### LangSmith SDK
The LangSmith SDK is automatically installed by AI Agents Force. However, it does not depend on
`langchain-core`, and can be installed and used independently if desired.
If you are not using AI Agents Force, you can install it with:

```bash
pip install langsmith
```

### From source

If you want to install a package from source, you can do so by cloning the [main AI Agents Force repo](https://github.com/AI-Agents-Force-SDK/langchain), enter the directory of the package you want to install `PATH/TO/REPO/langchain/libs/{package}`, and run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

LangGraph, LangSmith SDK, and certain integration packages live outside the main AI Agents Force repo. You can see [all repos here](https://github.com/AI-Agents-Force-SDK).
